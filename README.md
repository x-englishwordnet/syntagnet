# SyntagNet 1.0 for Open English Wordnet

### What is it ?

OEWN lacks collocation relations, i.e. relations of words + meanings on the
syntagmatic axis.

This brings __collocations__ to OEWN __as sense relations__
(a relation between two words, each within a semantic context
expressed by a synset)

The collocations here are provided by SyntagNet, a manually-curated large-scale lexical-semantic
combination database which associates pairs of concepts with pairs of co-occurring words,
hence capturing sense distinctions evoked by syntagmatic relations.

### Statistics

174768 collocations are added to OEWN (87384+87384, both ways),
616 failed due to 239 senses being obsoleted or some flawed symmetrical source data.


### Tools

The *augment.py* script here adds collocations to the YAML files as sense relations. It does not have any dependency apart from PyYAML.

[oewn-core](https://github.com/oewntk/oewn-core), a base python library for OEWN, has now a 
[oewn-syntagnet](https://github.com/oewntk/oewn-core/tree/main/oewn_syntagnet) module
that allows runtime injection of collocations into the OEWN model.
